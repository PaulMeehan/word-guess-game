This application is similar to the classic "hangman" game.  

**Starting the application:** To start the application, simply open the index.html file in a current browser.

**How the game works:** The application randomly selects a word or phrase.  The letters in each word are represented in the Current Puzzle with a "_", so the word APPLE would be represented with _ _ _ _ _ (a dot would be used to represent a space).  The user types in characters on the keyboard to make a guess.  If that letter appears anywhere in the hidden phrase, those letters will be revealed.  Using the same example, if the user types P, the Current Puzzle would show _ P P _ _.  If you reveal all of the letters, you win!  But if you don't get all the letters in 12 or fewer guesses, you lose.

After each round, a button will appear labeled "Start A New Round".  Click this button to have a new word selected and reset the counters.

*Hint:* This application has a "desserts" theme, so all of the puzzles are types of desserts.
